# Patron

## Description

Patron is an application designed for a user, or Patron, to utilize the entirety of the Metropolitan Museum of Art so that they may create their own personal gallery. Each user's individual gallery may be used to comment and reply to other user's comments on a particular artwork. Our app was designed so that everybody may access over 5,000 years of historic art and to engage in discussion with other users across the world.
